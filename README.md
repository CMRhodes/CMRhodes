Hi, I’m @CMRhodes, I’m interested in software engineering, but I've never been into computer science before!
The closest I've ever come to coding was writing episode stories :| 
I’m currently learning everything about coding, I plan to be self taught and learn as much as I can while putting in the practice!
I’m looking to collaborate on anything, I'm willing to learn, and would love any helpful advice and tips!
